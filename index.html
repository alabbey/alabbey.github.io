									<h4>About Alyssa</h4>
									<p>Alyssa grew up in Tucson, Arizona. Her dad Randy was born in New York and raised in Salt Lake City, UT and her mom, Sandra, born and raised in Salt Lake City, UT were excited to move south to the desert and “get away from the cold”. Tucson is where Alyssa developed her love of hot temperatures, bright sunshine, and summer monsoons. As a child her dreams ranged from growing up to be a ‘wiener dude’ (from a wienerschnitzel commercial with cool leather wearing teens), a restaurant owner, or a personal trainer. It wasn’t until one of her gymnastics coaches, Laura, told her she’d understand gymnastics better once she took physics, that Alyssa started considering a career in science. A serendipitous meeting with a geologist in her senior year of high school is really what kicked off the next stage of her life. Graduating from U of Arizona with degrees in Geoscience and French she decided to make the leap and pursue a PhD at U of Michigan...A daunting decision for a life-long desert dweller. Little did she know Michigan is where she would meet the love of her life.</p>

									<h4>About Daniel</h4>
									<p>Daniel was born and raised in Michigan and lived there for the first 25 years of his life. This explains his overwhelming about of clothing with Michigan-based sports teams logos.  His father, Kenneth, grew up in the New York area and built a career in interior construction. His mother, Candace, grew up in the small town of Big Rapids, MI and pursued a life of art and teaching. Daniel's love for all things Michigan intensified after 7 years at U of Michigan (college forever!). In his final year he met an incredible woman, and was forced with a tough decision when he got a dream job offer based in the Bay Area, CA.

								<h4><ion-icon name="heart" class="icon icon--sm icon--primary u-bg-grey d-none d-md-block"></ion-icon>First time we met</h4>
								<p>It was a cold snowy day in February when Alyssa went into Michigan’s University Health Service to get an x-ray on her ankle, which she hurt at a frisbee tournament the weekend before. In the x-ray waiting room sat another bundled up human wearing a Magnum Ultimate hat (the men’s frisbee team at U of M). Excited to find another frisbee person she introduced herself. Daniel was waiting to get an x-ray on his knee, which he had also hurt playing ultimate. They exchanged a short conversation and wished each other luck on their x-rays.</p>

								<h4>Six happy years</h4>
								<p>After several months as acquaintances hanging out randomly and at frisbee gatherings, Alyssa and Daniel started going on casual dates, a picnic here, a birthday dinner there. They were having a great time, but Daniel was finishing up school and got offered an amazing opportunity to take a job in San Francisco, and a big decision was upon them. The two decided to try the ‘long-distance thing’ even though Alyssa still had three years left at U of M. Making time to visit often, work remotely, and travel the world the two love birds made it work. Alyssa was able to join Daniel in the SF Bay Area in 2018 and they found a place to live together in Berkeley. After three years of long distance, Daniel and Alyssa found that living together was both fun and fulfilling, learning first hand that “team work makes the dream work”!</p>

								<h4><ion-icon name="heart" class="icon icon--sm icon--primary u-bg-grey d-none d-md-block"></ion-icon>She said yes!</h4>
								<p>Little did Alyssa know, Daniel had been working for four months on a secret custom engagement ring project with local jewelry designer and friend Rachel. Daniel knew that Alyssa would have high expectations for her engagement ring being a geologist. Daniel planned a seemingly normal camping trip in Napa California in December. The two had done dozens of trips like this in the past and Alyssa had no idea what was coming. The initial plan to propose at the campsite by a cozy fire was thwarted by a rainstorm. Plan B, to propose at a cool wine bar with live music, was halted when the wine bar closed early for the night. The increasingly eager Daniel was now fully winging it and waited for the right moment at the romantic Brasswood Bar. After a round of drinks, Daniel dropped to one knee and presented Alyssa with a beautiful ring, made from seven of Alyssa’s favorite gemstones. Luckily for Alyssa and Daniel, a large group of overzealous thirty-something ladies sitting nearby were able to get the whole restaurant roaring when they heard Alyssa nervously mutter the word “yes”, and simultaneously perform “gratis” photographer duties of the couples resulting smiles. The newly minted affianced couple  spent the rest of the romantic weekend celebrating their new titles in the Calistoga region of Napa with delicious wine tasting, splendid food and an afternoon in a Tuscan-style castle</p>

                        <h3>Celebration of Love & Friendship</h3>
						<h4>The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum</h4>
						<h6>2021 North Kinney Road Tucson, AZ 85743</h6>
                        <p>This is one of Alyssa’s favorite places! The Desert Museum is a zoo, art gallery, botanical garden, and natural history museum all combined together into an amazing celebration of the Sonoran desert. We suggest you spend the day exploring The Desert Museum on your own time before our event begins. It is an amazing place and we hope you begin to love and cherish it as much as we do! When the park closes at 5pm, Daniel and Alyssa’s 2nd celebration event will begin. </p>

						<h5>Schedule of Events:</h5>
						<li>Cocktail Hour and Desert Experience @ 5pm in the Desert Garden</li>
                        <p>Part of what The Desert Museum has to offer includes seeing and learning about desert flora and fauna. During the cocktail hour there will be docents around presenting different desert dwellers up-close! This will be a perfect time to ask all your questions about Barn Owls, Chuckwalla lizards, and Desert Tortoises!</p>
						<li>Celebration collaboration event @6pm in the Green Room</li>
                        <p>Love, appreciation, friendship, and memories can be expressed in so many ways. This collaboration event will be an opportunity for you to share your happiness and memories with the newlyweds! Bring all the creativity we know and love and share your thoughts, memories, advice, love and laughter with the whole party. Current submissions include short (1-5 min), slideshows, music (piano/keyboard, guitar, violin, etc.), speeches, poetry, and dances, but don’t let that limit you! If you require a specific instrument or display option let Tia Esposito know (friend of the bride); she will be contacting you when you RSVP and will be the coordinator for this portion of the event. Everyone is encouraged to contribute a ‘performance’ of sorts to celebrate Daniel and Alyssa, but this is not a requirement for the event! We want you there for this collaborative celebration in the beautiful desert no matter what!</p>
						<li>Dinner @7:30pm in the Green Room</li>
						<li>Open Mic @8:30-9pm in the Green Room</li>
                        <p>For those that didn’t submit an official contribution, but wish to add something to the event on the fly! </p>
                        <li>End @10pm</li>
                        <p>Note, young children are very welcome to attend this event and will love The Desert Museum!</p>

The Marshall Gulch trail is a nice hike through wildflowers in the mountains and can take you to other trails and overlooks.</li>
						<li><b><a href="https://www.nps.gov/sagu/index.htm"> Saguaro National Park.</b></a> There are two parts to this park East and West, both are great for camping, hiking, wildlife viewing, and cactus viewing ;)</li>

                        <h3>Celebration of Love & Friendship</h3>
						<h4>The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum</h4>
						<h6>2021 North Kinney Road Tucson, AZ 85743</h6>
                        <p>This is one of Alyssa’s favorite places! The Desert Museum is a zoo, art gallery, botanical garden, and natural history museum all combined together into an amazing celebration of the Sonoran desert. We suggest you spend the day exploring The Desert Museum on your own time before our event begins. It is an amazing place and we hope you begin to love and cherish it as much as we do! When the park closes at 5pm, Daniel and Alyssa’s 2nd celebration event will begin. </p>

						<h5>Schedule of Events:</h5>
						<li>Cocktail Hour and Desert Experience @ 5pm in the Desert Garden</li>
                        <p>Part of what The Desert Museum has to offer includes seeing and learning about desert flora and fauna. During the cocktail hour there will be docents around presenting different desert dwellers up-close! This will be a perfect time to ask all your questions about Barn Owls, Chuckwalla lizards, and Desert Tortoises!</p>
						<li>Celebration collaboration event @6pm in the Green Room</li>
                        <p>Love, appreciation, friendship, and memories can be expressed in so many ways. This collaboration event will be an opportunity for you to share your happiness and memories with the newlyweds! Bring all the creativity we know and love and share your thoughts, memories, advice, love and laughter with the whole party. Current submissions include short (1-5 min), slideshows, music (piano/keyboard, guitar, violin, etc.), speeches, poetry, and dances, but don’t let that limit you! If you require a specific instrument or display option let Tia Esposito know (friend of the bride); she will be contacting you when you RSVP and will be the coordinator for this portion of the event. Everyone is encouraged to contribute a ‘performance’ of sorts to celebrate Daniel and Alyssa, but this is not a requirement for the event! We want you there for this collaborative celebration in the beautiful desert no matter what!</p>
						<li>Dinner @7:30pm in the Green Room</li>
						<li>Open Mic @8:30-9pm in the Green Room</li>
